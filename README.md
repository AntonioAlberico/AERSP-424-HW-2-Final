# AERSP-424-HW-2-Final
This is Antonio's repository for AERSP 424 HW 2 Final Iteration

When you run this code, you might have to edit the CMakeChache.txt file in out>build>x64-Debug. If so, change all the lines from AERSP-424-HW-2-Final to wherever your directory is. The same will need to be done with the CMakeLists.txt file.

As far as the code goes, I hvae no idea why the planes are slow initially leaving SCE, but fast from there on out. I've checked my velocities for an exteneded run, and they do not change. I am assuming that is a function of the animation code, maybe.

I also tried to force aircraft to wait for room to land when there are 2 or more aircraft at SCE, but I am not totally sure if it worked.
